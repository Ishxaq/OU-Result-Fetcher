Results Fetcher is a project aimed at automating the process of fetching and visualizing academic results from Osmainia University webiste  of an entire class.
It is very simple to use. You only have to run the two python files.
But it is neccessary to input the range of roll nos you want to fecth the result for.
Here is the step by step procedure with example images:
1. clone the repository in your pc
2. install all required dependency from here
3. change the range of roll no in the OU_Results_Fetcher.py file and the link to results

4. This will create a excell file of the results for the desired roll nos in the same dir as this file.
5. Now to visualize this data open the Result_Visualizer.py and update the location of the excell file. Also upadte the name of your class
